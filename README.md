# Multi-Threaded Client-Server Application in C++

Welcome to the Multi-Threaded Client-Server C++ Application! This project demonstrates efficient communication between a client and server using socket programming, thread pooling, and the Factory Method design pattern in C++. Itâ€™s designed to handle both text messages and file transfers, with built-in features to ensure reliable communication.

Whether you're looking to explore multi-threading in C++, socket communication, or just want to build a solid foundation for your own networking projects, this application provides a clean and effective approach to client-server interaction.

# Key Features
  >Multi-Threaded Server: Handles multiple clients concurrently with a thread pool to optimize performance.
  >Socket Communication: Establishes reliable client-server communication using TCP sockets.
  >Factory Method Pattern: Dynamically creates client and server socket connections for scalability.
  >Text and File Transfer Support: Send and receive both text messages and files seamlessly.
  >Automated Build: Build and compile the project with a Makefile for easier management.
  >Client Retry Mechanism: Reconnect attempts for failed client-server communication, ensuring resilience.
  >IP & Port Validation: Ensures correct server IP and port before initiating connections.
